Word Analysis
Word analysis (etymology) is the process of separating a word into
its parts and then using the meanings of those parts to deduce the
meaning of the original word. Take, for example, the word
INTERMINABLE. It is made up of three parts: a prefix IN (not), a
root TERMIN (stop), and a suffix ABLE (can do). Therefore, by
word analysis, INTERMINABLE means “not able to stop.” This
is not the literal meaning of INTERMINABLE (endless), but it is
close enough. For another example, consider the word
RETROSPECT. It is made up of the prefix RETRO (back) and the
root SPECT (to look). Hence, RETROSPECT means “to look back
(in time), to contemplate.”
Word analysis is very effective in decoding the meaning of
words. However, you must be careful in its application since words
do not always have the same meaning as the sum of the meanings of
their parts. In fact, on occasion words can have the opposite
meaning of their parts. For example, by word analysis the word
AWFUL should mean “full of awe,” or awe-inspiring. But over the
years it has come to mean just the opposite—terrible. In spite of the
shortcomings, word analysis gives the correct meaning of a word (or
at least a hint of it) far more often than not and therefore is a useful
tool.
Examples:
INDEFATIGABLE
Analysis: IN (not); DE (thoroughly); FATIG (fatigue); ABLE (can do)
Meaning: cannot be fatigued, tireless
CIRCUMSPECT
Analysis: CIRCUM (around); SPECT (to look)
Meaning: to look around, that is, to be cautious
ANTIPATHY
Analysis: ANTI (against); PATH (to feel); Y (noun suffix)
Meaning: to feel strongly against something, to hate
OMNISCIENT
Analysis: OMNI (all); SCI (to know); ENT (noun suffix)
Meaning: all-knowing

Idiom & Usage
The field of grammar is huge and complex—tomes have been
written on the subject. This complexity should be no surprise since
grammar deals with the process of communication.
Usage concerns how we choose our words and how we express
our thoughts: in other words, are the connections between the words
in a sentence logically sound, and are they expressed in a way that
conforms to standard idiom? We will study six major categories:
• Pronoun Errors
• Subject-Verb Agreement
• Misplaced Modifiers
• Faulty Parallelism
• Faulty Verb Tense
• Faulty Idiom
118 Vocabulary 4000
PRONOUN ERRORS
A pronoun is a word that stands for a noun, known as the antecedent
of the pronoun. The key point for the use of pronouns is this:
• Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in both number
(singular or plural) and person (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Example:
Steve has yet to receive his degree.
Here, the pronoun his refers to the noun Steve.
Following is a list of the most common pronouns:
PRONOUNS
Singular Plural Both Singular
and Plural
I, me we, us any
she, her they none
he, him them all
it these most
anyone those more
either some who
each that which
many a both what
nothing ourselves you
one any
another many
everything few
mine several
his, hers others
this
that
 Idiom & Usage 119
Reference
• A pronoun should be plural when it refers to two nouns joined
by and.
Example:
Jane and Katarina believe they passed the final exam.
The plural pronoun they refers to the compound subject Jane
and Katarina.
• A pronoun should be singular when it refers to two nouns joined
by or or nor.
Faulty Usage
Neither Jane nor Katarina believes they passed
the final.
Correct
Neither Jane nor Katarina believes she passed the final.
• A pronoun should refer to one and only one noun or compound
noun.
This is probably the most common pronoun error. If a pronoun
follows two nouns, it is often unclear which of the nouns the
pronoun refers to.
Faulty Usage
The breakup of the Soviet Union has left nuclear
weapons in the hands of unstable, nascent
countries. It is imperative to world security that
they be destroyed.
Although one is unlikely to take the sentence to mean that the
countries must be destroyed, that interpretation is possible from
the structure of the sentence. It is easily corrected:
The breakup of the Soviet Union has left nuclear
weapons in the hands of unstable, nascent
countries. It is imperative to world security that
these weapons be destroyed.
120 Vocabulary 4000
Faulty Usage
In Somalia, they have become jaded by the
constant warfare.
This construction is faulty because they does not have an antecedent. The sentence can be corrected by replacing they with
people:
In Somalia, people have become jaded by the
constant warfare.
Better:
The people of Somalia have become jaded by the
constant warfare.
• In addition to agreeing with its antecedent in number, a pronoun
must agree with its antecedent in person.
Faulty Usage
One enters this world with no responsibilities.
Then comes school, then work, then marriage and
family. No wonder, you look longingly to
retirement.
In this sentence, the subject has changed from one (third person)
to you (second person). To correct the sentence either replace
one with you or vice versa:
You enter this world with no responsibilities.
Then comes school, then work, then marriage and
family. No wonder, you look longingly to
retirement.
One enters this world with no responsibilities.
Then comes school, then work, then marriage and
family. No wonder, one looks longingly to
retirement.

 Idiom & Usage 123
SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT
Within a sentence there are certain requirements for the relationship
between the subject and the verb.
• The subject and verb must agree both in number and person.
Example:
We have surpassed our sales goal of one million dollars.
Here, the first person plural verb have agrees with its first person
plural subject we.
Note, ironically, third person singular verbs often end in s or es:
He seems to be fair.
• Intervening phrases and clauses have no effect on subject-verb
agreement.
Example:
Only one of the President’s nominees was confirmed.
Here, the singular verb was agrees with its singular subject one. The intervening prepositional phrase of the President’s nominees
has no effect on the number or person of the verb.
• When the subject and verb are reversed, they still must agree in
both number and person.
Example:
Attached are copies of the contract.
Here, the plural verb are attached agrees with its plural subject
copies. The sentence could be rewritten as
Copies of the contract are attached.

MISPLACED MODIFIERS
• As a general rule, a modifier should be placed as close as
possible to what it modifies.
Example:
Following are some useful tips for protecting
your person and property from the FBI.
As written, the sentence implies that the FBI is a threat to your
person and property. To correct the sentence put the modifier
from the FBI next to the word it modifies, tips:
Following are some useful tips from the FBI for
protecting your person and property.
• When a phrase begins a sentence, make sure that it modifies the
subject of the sentence.
Example:
Coming around the corner, a few moments
passed before I could recognize my old home.
As worded, the sentence implies that the moments were coming
around the corner. The sentence can be corrected as follows:
126 Vocabulary 4000
As I came around the corner, a few moments
passed before I could recognize my old home.
or
Coming around the corner, I paused a few
moments before I could recognize my old home.

and shooting the vast expanse of the Southwest.

FAULTY PARALLELISM
• For a sentence to be parallel, similar elements must be expressed
in similar form.
• When two adjectives modify the same noun, they should have
similar forms.
Example:
The topology course was both rigorous and a
challenge.
Since both rigorous and a challenge are modifying course, they
should have the same form:
The topology course was both rigorous and
challenging.
128 Vocabulary 4000
• When a series of clauses is listed, the verbs in each clause must
have the same form.
Example:
During his trip to Europe, the President will
discuss ways to stimulate trade, offer economic
aid, and trying to forge a new coalition with
moderate forces in Russia.
In this example, the first two verbs, discuss and offer, are active.
But the third verb in the series, trying, is passive. The form of
the verb should be active:
During his trip to Europe, the President will
discuss ways to stimulate trade, offer economic
aid, and try to forge a new coalition with
moderate forces in Russia.
• When the first half of a sentence has a certain structure, the
second half should preserve that structure.
Example:
To acknowledge that one is an alcoholic is taking
the first and hardest step to recovery.
The first half of the above sentence has an infinitive structure, to
acknowledge, so the second half must have a similar structure:
To acknowledge that one is an alcoholic is to take
the first and hardest step to recovery.

One another/Each other:
Each other should be used when referring to two things, and one
another should be used when referring to more than two things.
The members of the basketball team (more than two)
congratulated one another on their victory.
The business partners (two) congratulated each other on
their successful first year.
Plus vs. And:
Do not use plus as a conjunction meaning and.
(Faulty) His contributions to this community are
considerable, plus his character is beyond
reproach.
(Correct) His contributions to this community are
considerable, and his character is beyond
reproach.
Note: Plus can be used to mean and so long as it is not being used
as a conjunction.
(Acceptable) His generous financial contribution
plus his donated time has made this
project a success.
In this sentence, plus is being used as a preposition. Note that the
verb has is singular because an intervening prepositional phrase
(plus his donated time) does not affect subject verb agreement.
Regard vs. Regards:
Unless you are giving best wishes to someone, you should use
regard.
(Faulty) In regards to your letter, we would be
interested in distributing your product.
(Correct) In regard to your letter, we would be
interested in distributing your product.

The tax increase is retroactive to February.
Speak to/with:
To speak to someone is to tell them something:
We spoke to Jennings about the alleged embezzlement.

1. Had the President’s Administration not lost the vote on the budget reduction
package, his first year in office would have been rated an A.
(A) Had the President’s Administration not lost the vote on the budget
reduction package, his first year in office would have been rated an A.
(B) If the Administration had not lost the vote on the budget reduction
package, his first year in office would have been rated an A.
(C) Had the President’s Administration not lost the vote on the budget
reduction package, it would have been rated an A.
(D) Had the President’s Administration not lost the vote on its budget
reduction package, his first year in office would have been rated an A.
(E) If the President had not lost the vote on the budget reduction package,
the Administration’s first year in office would have been rated an A.
Choice (A) is incorrect because his appears to refer to the President, but the subject of the subordinate clause is the President’s
Administration, not the President.
Choice (B) changes the structure of the sentence, but retains the
same flawed reference.
In choice (C), it can refer to either the President’s
Administration or the budget reduction package. Thus, the reference is ambiguous.
Choice (D) adds another pronoun, its, but still retains the same
flawed reference.
Choice (E) corrects the flawed reference by removing all
pronouns. The answer is (E).
2. The new law requires a manufacturer to immediately notify their customers
whenever the government is contemplating a forced recall of any of the

(A) to immediately notify their customers whenever the government is
contemplating a forced recall of any of the manufacturer’s products.
(B) to immediately notify customers whenever the government is
contemplating a forced recall of their products.
(C) to immediately, and without delay, notify its customers whenever the
government is contemplating a forced recall of any of the
manufacture’s products.
(D) to immediately notify whenever the government is contemplating a
forced recall of any of the manufacturer’s products that the customers
may have bought.
(E) to immediately notify its customers whenever the government is
contemplating a forced recall of any of the manufacturer’s products.
 Idiom & Usage 143
Choice (A) is incorrect because the plural pronoun their cannot have
the singular noun a manufacturer as its antecedent.
Although choice (B) corrects the given false reference, it
introduces another one. Their can now refer to either customers or
government, neither of which would make sense in this context.
Choice (C) also corrects the false reference, but it introduces a
redundancy: immediately means “without delay.”
Choice (D) corrects the false reference, but its structure is very
awkward. The direct object of a verb should be as close to the verb
as possible. In this case, the verb notify is separated from its direct
object customers by the clause “that the government is
contemplating a forced recall of any of the manufacturer’s products
that.”
Choice (E) is correct because the singular pronoun its has the
singular noun a manufacturer as its antecedent. The answer is (E).
3. World War II taught the United States the folly of punishing a vanquished
aggressor; so after the war, they enacted the Marshall Plan to rebuild
Germany.
(A) after the war, they enacted the Marshall Plan to rebuild Germany.
(B) after the war, the Marshall Plan was enacted to rebuild Germany.
(C) after the war, the Marshall Plan was enacted by the United States to
rebuild Germany.
(D) after the war, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan to rebuild
Germany.
(E) after the war, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan in order to
rebuild Germany.
Choice (A) is incorrect. Since United States is denoting the
collective country, it is singular and therefore cannot be correctly
referred to by the plural pronoun they.
Choice (B) is not technically incorrect, but it lacks precision
since it does not state who enacted the Marshall Plan. Further, it
uses a passive construction: “was enacted.”
Choice (C) states who enacted the Marshall Plan, but it retains
the passive construction “was enacted.”
Choice (E) is second-best. The phrase “in order” is
unnecessary.
Choice (D) corrects the false reference by replacing they with
the United States. Further, it uses the active verb enacted instead of
the passive verb was enacted. The answer is (D).

4. In the 1950’s, integration was an anathema to most Americans; now,
however, most Americans accept it as desirable.
(A) to most Americans; now, however, most Americans accept it as
desirable.
(B) to most Americans, now, however, most Americans accept it.
(C) to most Americans; now, however, most Americans are desirable of it.
(D) to most Americans; now, however, most Americans accepted it as
desirable.
(E) to most Americans. Now, however, most Americans will accept it as
desirable.
The sentence is not incorrect as written. Hence, the answer is choice
(A).
Choice (B) creates a run-on sentence by replacing the
semicolon with a comma. Without a connecting word—and, or, but, etc.—two independent clauses must be joined by a semicolon or
written as two separate sentences. Also, deleting “as desirable”
changes the meaning of the sentence.
Choice (C) uses a very awkward construction: are desirable of
it.
Choice (D) contains an error in tense. The sentence progresses
from the past to the present, so the verb in the second clause should
be accept, not accepted.
Choice (E) writes the two clauses as separate sentences, which
is allowable, but it also changes the tense of the second clause to the
future: will accept.
5. Geologists in California have discovered a fault near the famous San
Andreas Fault, one that they believe to be a trigger for major quakes on the
San Andreas.
(A) one that they believe to be a trigger for
(B) one they believe to be a trigger for
(C) one that they believe triggers
(D) that they believe to be a trigger for
(E) one they believe acts as a trigger for
Choice (A) is incorrect since the relative pronoun that is redundant:
the pronoun one, which refers to the newly discovered fault, is
sufficient.
Although choice (C) reads more smoothly, it still contains the
double pronouns.
 Idiom & Usage 145
Choice (D) is incorrect. Generally, relative pronouns such as
that refer to whole ideas in previous clauses or sentences. Since the
second sentence is about the fault and not its discovery, the pronoun
that is appropriate.
Choice (E) is very tempting. It actually reads better than choice
(A), but it contains a subtle flaw. One is the direct object of the verb
believes and therefore cannot be the subject of the verb acts. Since
they clearly is not the subject, the verb acts is without a subject.
Choice (B) has both the correct pronoun and the correct verb
form. The answer is (B).
6. A bite from the tsetse fly invariably paralyzes its victims unless an antidote
is administered within two hours.
(A) its victims unless an antidote is administered
(B) its victims unless an antidote can be administered
(C) its victims unless an antidote was administered
(D) its victims unless an antidote is administered to the victims
(E) its victims unless they receive an antidote
Choice (A) is incorrect since it is unclear whether the victim or the
fly should receive the antidote.
Choice (B) is incorrect since is is more direct than can be.
Choice (C) is incorrect. A statement of fact should be
expressed in the present tense, not the past tense.
Choice (D) is wordy. A pronoun should be used for the phrase
the victims.
Choice (E) is the answer since they correctly identifies who
should receive the antidote.

1. The rising cost of government bureaucracy have made it all but impossible
to reign in the budget deficit.
(A) The rising cost
(B) Since the rising costs
(C) Because of the rising costs
(D) The rising costs
(E) Rising cost
Choice (A) is incorrect because the plural verb have does not agree
with its singular subject the rising cost.
Both (B) and (C) are incorrect because they turn the sentence
into a fragment.
Choice (E) is incorrect because rising cost is still singular.
Choice (D) is the correct answer since now the plural verb have
agrees with its plural subject the rising costs.
2. In a co-publication agreement, ownership of both the material and its means
of distribution are equally shared by the parties.
(A) its means of distribution are equally shared by the parties.
(B) its means of distribution are shared equally by each of the parties.
(C) its means of distribution is equally shared by the parties.
(D) their means of distribution is equally shared by the parties.
(E) the means of distribution are equally shared by the parties.
Choice (A) is incorrect. Recall that intervening phrases have no
effect on subject-verb agreement. In this sentence, the subject
ownership is singular, but the verb are is plural. Dropping the
intervening phrase clearly shows that the sentence is ungrammatical:
In a co-publication, agreement ownership are equally
shared by the parties.
Choice (B) is incorrect. Neither adding each of nor interchanging shared and equally addresses the issue of subject-verb
agreement.
Choice (D) contains a faulty pronoun reference. The antecedent
of the plural pronoun their would be the singular noun material.
Choice (E) is incorrect since it still contains the plural verb are. The answer is choice (C).

3. The rise in negative attitudes toward foreigners indicate that the country is
becoming less tolerant, and therefore that the opportunities are ripe for
extremist groups to exploit the illegal immigration problem.
(A) indicate that the country is becoming less tolerant, and therefore that
(B) indicates that the country is becoming less tolerant, and therefore
(C) indicates that the country is becoming less tolerant, and therefore that
(D) indicates that the country is being less tolerant, and therefore
(E) indicates that the country is becoming less tolerant of and therefore
that
Choice (A) has two flaws. First, the subject of the sentence the rise
is singular, and therefore the verb indicate should not be plural.
Second, the comma indicates that the sentence is made up of two
independent clauses, but the relative pronoun that immediately
following therefore forms a subordinate clause.
Choice (C) corrects the number of the verb, but retains the
subordinating relative pronoun that.
Choice (D) corrects the number of the verb and eliminates the
subordinating relative pronoun that. However, the verb being is less
descriptive than the verb becoming: As negative attitudes toward
foreigners increase, the country becomes correspondingly less
tolerant. Being does not capture this notion of change.
Choice (E) corrects the verb’s number, and by dropping the
comma, makes the subordination allowable. However, it introduces
the preposition of which does not have an object: less tolerant of
what?
Choice (B) both corrects the verb’s number and removes the
subordinating relative pronoun that. The answer is (B).
4. The harvest of grapes in the local valleys decreased in 1990 for the third
straight year but were still at a robust level.
(A) The harvest of grapes in the local valleys decreased in 1990 for the

the third straight year but were
(C) In 1990, the harvest of grapes in the local valleys decreased for the
third straight year but were
(D) The harvest of grapes in the local valleys decreased for the third
straight year in 1990 but was
(E) The harvest of grapes in the local valleys began decreasing in 1990 for
the third straight year but was
148 Vocabulary 4000
Choice (A) is incorrect since the singular subject the harvest
requires a singular verb, not the plural verb were.
Choice (B) is illogical since it states that the harvest began to
decrease in 1990 and then it states that it was the third straight year
of decrease.
In choice (C) the plural verb were still does not agree with its
singular subject the harvest.
Choice (E) contains the same flaw as choice (B).
Choice (D) has the singular verb was agreeing with its singular
subject the harvest. Further, it places the phrase in 1990 more
naturally. The answer is (D).

Thomas—have
(C) All the book’s protagonists—Mark Streit, Mary Eby, and Dr.
Thomas—has
(D) Mark Streit, Mary Eby, and Dr. Thomas—the book’s protagonists—
each has
(E) Each of the book’s protagonists—Mark Streit, Mary Eby, and Dr.
Thomas—could have had
The sentence is grammatical as written. The answer is (A).
When each, every, or many a precedes two or more subjects
linked by and, they separate the subjects and the verb is singular.
Hence, in choice (B) the plural verb have is incorrect.
Choice (C) is incorrect since the singular verb has does not
agree with the plural subject all.
When each follows a plural subject it does not separate the
subjects and the verb remains plural. Hence, in choice (D) the
singular verb has is incorrect.
Choice (E) also changes the meaning of the original sentence,
which states that the protagonist do have powerful, dynamic
personalities.

the loss of community, etc.—have been overlooked by sociologists.
(E) sociologists have overlooked the other causes of crime—such as the
breakup of the nuclear family, changing morals, the loss of
community, etc.
Choice (A) is incorrect since it implies that the other causes of crime
are doing the focusing.
Choice (B) has the same flaw.
Choice (C) is incorrect. The phrase by focusing on poverty
must modify the subject of the sentence, but there cannot be the
subject since the construction there are is used to introduce a
subject.
Choice (D) implies that crimes are focusing on poverty.
Choice (E) puts the subject of the sentence sociologists immediately next to its modifying phrase by focusing on poverty. The
answer is (E).

(D) Using the Hubble telescope, astronomers are now charting previously
unknown galaxies.
(E) With the aid of the Hubble telescope, previously unknown galaxies are

150 Vocabulary 4000
Choice (A) is incorrect because the phrase using the Hubble
telescope does not have a noun to modify.
Choice (B) is incorrect because the phrase using the Hubble
telescope still does not have a noun to modify.
Choice (C) offers a noun, astronomers, but it is too far from the
phrase using the Hubble telescope.
In choice (E), the phrase with the aid of the Hubble telescope
does not have a noun to modify.
Choice (D) offers a noun, astronomers, and places it immediately after the modifying phrase using the Hubble telescope. The
answer is (D).

stranded motorists unless well-insulated with protective clothing.
(A) stranded motorists unless insulated
(B) stranded motorists unless being insulated
(C) stranded motorists unless they are insulated
(D) stranded motorists unless there is insulation
(E) the stranded motorist unless insulated
Choice (A) is incorrect. As worded, the sentence implies that the
cold should be well insulated.
Choice (B) is awkward; besides, it still implies that the cold
should be well insulated.
Choice (D) does not indicate what should be insulated.
Choice (E), like choices (A) and (B), implies that the cold

Choice (C) is the answer since it correctly implies that the
stranded motorists should be well insulated with protective clothing.

(D) Ansel Adams, in 1945 began his photographic career, traveling across
and shooting the vast expanse of the Southwest.
(E) Traveling across and shooting the vast expanse of the Southwest,
Ansel Adams began his photographic career in 1945.
Choice (A) has two flaws. First, the introductory phrase is too long.
Second, the subject Ansel Adams should immediately follow the
introductory phrase since it was Ansel Adams—not the year 1945—
who was traveling and shooting the Southwest.
Choice (B) is incorrect because the phrase “traveling across…
Southwest” is too far from its subject Ansel Adams. As written, the
sentence seems to imply that the photographic career was traveling
across and shooting the Southwest.
Choice (C) is inconsistent in verb tense. Further, it implies that
Adams began his photographic career after he traveled across the
Southwest.
Choice (D) is awkward.
The best answer is choice (E).

result in better health.
(A) eating properly will result
(B) proper diet resulted
(C) dieting will result
(D) proper diet results
(E) eating properly results
Choice (A) is incorrect since eating properly (verb-adverb) is not
parallel to sensible exercise (adjective-noun).
Choice (B) offers two parallel nouns, exercise and diet.
However, a general truth should be expressed in the present tense,
not in the past tense.
Choice (C) is not parallel since it pairs the noun exercise with
the gerund (a verb acting as a noun) dieting.
Choice (E) makes the same mistake as choice (A).
Choice (D) offers two parallel nouns—exercise and diet—and
two parallel verbs—tells and results. The answer is (D).

communication age.
(D) war brewing in Europe, the industrial revolution well-established, and
the communication age beginning.
(E) war brewing in Europe, the industrial revolution well-established, and
saw the birth of the communication age.
Choice (A) is incorrect. Although the first two phrases, war
brewing in Europe and the industrial revolution well-established,
have different structures, the thoughts are parallel. However, the
third phrase, and a nascent communication age, is not parallel to the
first two.
Choice (B) does not make the third phrase parallel to the first
two.
 Idiom & Usage 153
Choice (C) changes the meaning of the sentence: the new
formulation states that war already existed in Europe while the
original sentence states that war was only developing.
Choice (E) is not parallel since the first two phrases in the series
are noun phrases, but saw the birth of the communication age is a
verb phrase. When a word introduces a series, each element of the
series must agree with the introductory word. You can test the
correctness of a phrase in a series by dropping the other phrases and
checking whether the remaining phrase agrees with the introductory
word. In this series, each phrase must be the object of the
preposition with:
This century began with war brewing in Europe
This century began with the industrial revolution well-established
This century began with saw the birth of the communication age
In this form, it is clear the verb saw cannot be the object of the
preposition with.
Choice (D) offers three phrases in parallel form. The answer is
(D).

(C) to try repairing an old car than to junking it.
(D) to try and repair an old car than to junk it.
(E) to try to repair an old car than to junk it.
Choice (A) is incorrect since the verb repairing is not parallel to the
verb junk.
In choice (B), the construction have it junked is awkward.
Further, it changes the original construction from active to passive.
Choice (C) offers a parallel construction (repairing/junking),
but it is awkward.
Choice (D) also offers a parallel construction (repair/junk), but

(B) having chosen to return to the private sector.
(C) chose to return to the private sector.
(D) have chosen to return to the private sector.
(E) have chosen returning to the private sector.
Choice (A) is incorrect because it uses the past perfect had chosen, which describes an event that has been completed before another
event. But the sentence implies that teachers have and are continuing
to return to the private sector. Hence, the present perfect tense
should be used.
Choice (B) is incorrect because it uses the present progressive
tense having chosen, which describes an ongoing event. Although
this is the case, it does not capture the fact that the event began in the
past.
Choice (C) is incorrect because it uses the simple past chose, which describes a past event. But again, the sentence implies that the
teachers are continuing to opt for the private sector.
Choice (D) is the correct answer because it uses the present
perfect have chosen to describe an event that occurred in the past and
is continuing into the present.

destroyed them.

Choice (B) merely rearranges the wording while retaining the
simple past were.
Choice (C) is the correct answer because it uses the past perfect
had been to indicate that the homes were completely built before
they were destroyed by the fires.
Choice (D) is incorrect because it uses the present perfect have
been, which implies that the homes were destroyed before being
built.
Choice (E) is incorrect. Although dropping the phrase that
were makes the sentence more concise, the past progressive were
being implies that the homes were destroyed while being built.
3. Although World War II ended nearly a half century ago, Russia and Japan
still have not signed a formal peace treaty; and both countries have been
reticent to develop closer relations.
(A) have not signed a formal peace treaty; and both countries have been
(B) did not signed a formal peace treaty; and both countries have been
(C) have not signed a formal peace treaty; and both countries being
(D) have not signed a formal peace treaty; and both countries are
(E) are not signing a formal peace treaty; and both countries have been
The sentence is grammatical as written. The present perfect verb
have … signed correctly indicates that they have not signed a peace
treaty and are not on the verge of signing one. Further, the present
perfect verb have been correctly indicates that in the past both
countries have been reluctant to develop closer relations and are still
reluctant. The answer is (A).
In choice (B), the simple past did does not capture the fact that
they did not sign a peace treaty immediately after the war and still
have not signed one.
Choice (C) is very awkward, and the present progressive being
does not capture the fact that the countries have been reluctant to
thaw relations since after the war up through the present.
In choice (D), the present tense are leaves open the possibility
that in the past the countries may have desired closer relations but
now no longer do.
In choice (E), the present progressive tense are … signing, as in
choice (D), leaves open the possibility that in the past the countries
may have desired closer relations but now no longer do.

4. The Democrats have accused the Republicans of resorting to dirty tricks by
planting a mole on the Democrat’s planning committee and then used the
information obtained to sabotage the Democrat’s campaign.
(A) used the information obtained to sabotage
(B) used the information they had obtained to sabotage
(C) of using the information they had obtained to sabotage
(D) using the information obtained to sabotage
(E) to have used the information obtained to sabotage
Choice (A) is incorrect because the simple past obtained does not
express the fact that the information was gotten before another past
action—the sabotage.
Choice (B) is incorrect because used is not parallel to of
resorting.
Choice (C) is correct because the phrase of using is parallel to
the phrase of resorting. Further, the past perfect had obtained
correctly expresses that a past action—the spying—was completed
before another past action—the sabotage.
Choice (D) is incorrect because using is not parallel to of
resorting and the past perfect is not used.
Choice (E) is incorrect because to have used is not parallel to of
resorting and the past perfect is not used.

2. Unless you maintain at least a 2.0 GPA, you will not graduate medical
school.
(A) you will not graduate medical school.
(B) you will not be graduated from medical school.
(C) you will not be graduating medical school.
(D) you will not graduate from medical school.
(E) you will graduate medical school.
Choice (A) is incorrect. In this context, graduate requires the word
from: “you will not graduate from medical school.”
The use of the passive voice in choices (B) and (C) weakens the
sentence.
Choice (D) is the answer since it uses the correct idiom
graduate from.
Choice (E) changes the meaning of the sentence and does not
correct the faulty idiom.
3. The studio’s retrospective art exhibit refers back to a simpler time in
American history.
(A) The studio’s retrospective art exhibit refers back to
(B) The studio’s retrospective art exhibit harkens back to
(C) The studio’s retrospective art exhibit refers to
(D) The studio’s retrospective art exhibit refers from
(E) The studio’s retrospective art exhibit looks back to
Choice (A) is incorrect. Retrospective means looking back on the
past. Hence, in the phrase refers back, the word back is redundant.
Choice (B) is incorrect because harkens back is also redundant.
Choice (C) is correct. Dropping the word back eliminates the
redundancy.
Choice (D) is incorrect because the preposition from is nonidiomatic.
Choice (E) is incorrect because looks back is also redundant.

4. Due to the chemical spill, the commute into the city will be delayed by as
much as 2 hours.
(A) Due to the chemical spill, the commute into the city will be delayed
by as much as 2 hours.
(B) The reason that the commute into the city will be delayed by as much
as 2 hours is because of the chemical spill.

by as much as 2 hours.
(D) Because of the chemical spill, the commute into the city will be
delayed by as much as 2 hours.
(E) The chemical spill will be delaying the commute into the city by as
much as 2 hours.
Choice (A) is incorrect. Although many educated writers and
speakers begin sentences with due to, it is almost always incorrect.
Choice (B) is incorrect: it is both redundant and awkward.
Choice (C) is incorrect. The past perfect had been delayed
implies the delay no longer exists. Hence, the meaning of the
sentence has been changed.
Choice (D) is correct. In general, due to should not be used as
a substitute for because of, owing to, by reason of, etc.
Choice (E) is incorrect. The future progressive will be delaying
is unnecessary and ponderous. Had choice (E) used the simple
future will delay, it would have been better that choice (D) because
then it would be more direct and active.
